# Hola!

Everybody always starts with what they do, I am not like others, so I am just gonna say that HTML and CSS aren't programming languages and electrical engineering is self-harming. Now - it's the right time to tell you, who the fuck I am and what what you'll be able to find here, so I am just student from Czech Republic. (It's a little country in the middle of Europe, it isn't jungle, desert or i don't know what you probably thought. Basically I study electrical engineering so I know what I'm talking about when I told that my profession is self-harming. Also I'm interested in web development, programming and ethical hacking.

## What will you be able to find here?

Ye, exactly - nothing interesting just couple of my web templates, which are based on `HTML` & `CSS` & `JS` or `React`, probably you'll be able to find here something like Minecraft plugins, because I am the guy who likes doing custom-made plugins.<br>
In case you'll be able to find here also something from my YouTube channel.
