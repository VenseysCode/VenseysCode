### ÄŒau!

Everybody always starts with what they do, I am not like others, so I am just gonna say that HTML and CSS aren't programming languages and studying electrical engineering is self-harming. Now - It's the right time to tell you, who the fuck I am and what you could find here, so I am just student from Czech Republic. (It's a small country in the middle of the Europe, it isn't jungle, desert or i don't know what you probably thought. Basically I'm studying electrical engineering so I know what I'm talking about when I told that my profession is self-harming. Also I'm interested in web development, programming and ethical hacking.

## What could you find here?

Ye, exactly - nothing interesting just couple of my web templates, which are based on HTML & CSS & JS or React, probably you'll can find here something like Minecraft plugins, because I am the guy who likes doing custom-made plugins.<br>
In case you could find here also something from my YouTube channel.
